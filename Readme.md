# Supabase-Powered CV Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **CV Management System powered by Supabase and AI**, developed during the internship program at **Softworld Việt Nam**.  
The system is designed to streamline **CV tracking, parsing, and candidate management** using:
- **Supabase** as backend (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Deployment)  
- **v0 AI Agent** for frontend UI generation and integration with LLM  
- **AI-based CV parsing & candidate matching**  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a modern, scalable CV management web application.  
- Automate CV parsing with AI to reduce manual effort.  
- Provide smart candidate-job matching functionality.  
- Deliver a production-ready system with documentation and demo.
